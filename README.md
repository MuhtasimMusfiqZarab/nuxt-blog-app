problems faced:

- not toggling while chicked
- default is not needed why ?
- structure of double quote used inside attributes
- component is auto default exported? (why we are default inporting without exporting defaultly)
- using javascript assignments inside of double quotes
  -naming of the default index.vue convention
  -router.push navigates to an absolute path?
